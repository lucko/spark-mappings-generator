# spark-mappings-generator

A collection of (somewhat scruffy) Java code that generates the mappings data used by the [spark viewer](https://github.com/lucko/spark-viewer) web app. Once generated, mappings are published using GitHub Pages at [lucko/spark-mappings](https://github.com/lucko/spark-mappings).

Uses the [FabricMC/mapping-io](https://github.com/FabricMC/mapping-io) library to handle the various mapping formats.
